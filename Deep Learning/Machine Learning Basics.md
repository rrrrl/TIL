# Lecture 1 : Machine Learning Basics

## Machine Learaning 머신러닝이란
- Limitations of explicit programming
  - Spam filter : many rules
  - Automatic driving 자동 주행 : too many rules

- Machine learning : "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"
                      Arthur Samuel(1959)


## Supervised / Unsupervised learning 학습방법에 따라 나뉨
- Supervised learning:
  - learning with labeled examples - tranining set 예제 레이블을 이용하여 학습
- Unsupervised learning : un-labeled data
  - Google news grouping
  - Word clustering


## Supervised learning
- Most common problem type in ML
  - Image labeling : learning from tagged images
  - Email spam filter : learning from labeled (spam or ham) email
  - Predicting exam score : learning from previous exam score and time spent


## Types of supervised learning
- Predicting final exam score based on time spent
  - regression
- Pass/non-passed based on time spent
  - binary classification
- Letter grade (A,B,C,E and F) based on time spent
  - multi-label classification
